* All tetrix stock parts are in *"tetrix kit parts"*
* If you are uploading a part you have made, put it in the *"Team Parts"* folder with your name and the name of the part in the filename
* Please *do not* put anything in the "SOLIDWORKS ASSEMBLIES" Folder (Large assemblies can get hectic so it's important to stay organized)
